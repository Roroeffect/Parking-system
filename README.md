# Parking system

This is a parking system I attempted to implement by using Java and principles of OOP.
Designed a parking system that logs in the parking spaces of visitor and residents in a condo and issues
tickets for parking.
Used principles of OOP and implemented a Java based GUI to display the logs to show which resident is
parked in which parking space and if the parked car belongs to a resident or a visitor.
